# Macronutrients-counter-ai
IT Project 

In this project we are going to make an AI Macronutrient counter. The goal is to put food in front of the camera and have the model recognize the food and use Groq's Llama-3.1-8b-instant model to find the macronutrients and display them onto a LED screen.

Download food recognition model from HuggingFace:

     - nateraw/vit-base-food101

 Upload Arduino Code:

     -The code will display the proteins, fats and carboohydrates on a screen.

Connect Python code to Arduino:

     -Put Python code into Visual Studio Code
     
     -Code should reference the food recognition model and Groq Llama-3.1-8b-instant model to classify the food and estimate macronutrients.

Systems used:

     -Python 3.12


     -PyTorch


     -Arduino IDE


     -Ardiuno Mega 2560


     -OpenCV


     -PySerial
