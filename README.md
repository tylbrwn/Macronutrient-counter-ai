# Macronutrients-counter-ai
IT Project 

In this project we are going to make an AI Macronutrient counter. The goal is to have be able to put food in front of a camera and have the model recognize the food and use OpenAI to find the macronutrients and light up designated lights to signal if the food has the recommended amount of protein, carbohydrates or fats.

Food recognition model:

     - nateraw/vit-base-food101

 Upload Arduino Code:


     -The code will display the proteins, fats and carboohydrates on a screen.

Connect Python code to Arduino:

     -Put Python code into Visual Studio Code
     

     -Code should reference the food recognition model and OpenAI's 3.5 model to classify the food and estimate macronutrients.

Systems used:

     -Python 3.12


     -PyTorch


     -Arduino IDE


     -Ardiuno Mega 2560


     -OpenCV


     -PySerial
